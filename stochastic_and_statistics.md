# Probability Theory and Statistic: The interaction between your assumptions and the Real World
Most people would say the chance of seeing a 6 after roling a dice is 1 in 6, or 16.66\%. Also most of those people would reason their claim with something like:

'The dice has 6 sides and it is equally likely that the dice lands on any of the 6 sides. Therefore the likelihood is 1 in 6.'

But I don't know a single of my friends that could explain to me 'why the chances are equal for all the 6 sides', and why it is not possible, that the likelihood of seeing 1 is twice the likelihood of seeing 4. For an explanation we probably have to ask some learned physicist, but most of the time we go with our gutfeeling. This gutfeeling tells us that we can expect to see a 6 roughly every 6th role of the dice, but the outcome is random. This gutfeeling represents what is called a **probabilistic model** in the field of **Probability Theory**. Such a **probabilistic model** is used to model any real world phenomen, where randomness is involved. The **probabilistic model** incorporate all our assumptions about the random process we want to model. The key features of the models are:

* What possible outcomes do I expect from the process. In the case of rolling a dice we expect to either see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
* What is the probability of any of the possible outcomes. In the case of rolling a fair dice we assume that it is 16.66/% for each of the possible outcomes

**Probabilistic models** are a theoretical concept, that is used to model real world events. As is the case with most models, a **probabilistic model** is rarely perfect, but should be good enough
