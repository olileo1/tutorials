# Getting to an environment to Develop Python Code
If you already know how to setup your preferred Python Development Environment the tutorials contained in this folder will probably bore you. If not let me quickly explain to you what you will happen in the two tutorials and what we are going to setup:

1. *Local Setup*: You will install Visual Studio Code on your Computer. Visual Studio Code is a Code editor with many nice features for Python Code Development. 
2. *Cloud Setup*: We will set up a Runtime environment with a Linux OS, Python and Anaconda. I will show you two ways of doing this:
    - on your Windows Computer using the Windows Subsystem Linux (wsl2)
    - using a Microsoft Azure Subscription and Azure ML

## *Local Setup* vs. *Cloud Setup*:

Pros of *Local Setup*:

* if you already own a Computer with Windows on it, there are not further costs involved
* you learn a little bit of Linux and gain experience with working on a Linux environment

Pros of [*Cloud Setup*](dev_setup/azure_ml/README.md):

* very easy and you can basically do anything with mouse clicks
* Azure ML provides nice possibilities for you to work only via the Browser. So you don't need to install anything on your device, besides a Browser. This is perfect if you want to work from your Tablet or even Smartphone
* you gain experience with the Azure Cloud
* BUT, there are costs involved with the Cloud. If you are careful, those costs will be in the single-digit region per month, but if you are careless and for example forget to turn of your Cloud Compute Machines, the costs can become quite high

## Install Visual Studio Code on your Windows Computer
Installing Visual Studio Code on your Windows Computer is straightforward and easy. Just download the latest version from the [Official Visual Studio Code Homepage](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install it.

Once you have Visual Studio Code install, I recommend you to install the [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

For further details please check the [VS Code Documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
