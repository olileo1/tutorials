# Setup Azure ML
Setting up Azure ML in the Microsoft Azure Cloud is really easy. For me it went so quickly and smoothless I even forgot to take notes. So, I am sorry that I can not provide you with a detailed how to, but I will tell you the main steps you have to do:

1. Create a Microsoft Azure account. For that simply go to the [Azure Homepage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) and get started. I think Microsoft even gives you a couple hundred dollars of free credits to use on their services. If you are only planning on using Azure for these tutorials, the monthly costs should be far below 10€/month.
2. Once you have created a Microsoft Azure Account you can go to the [Azure Portal](portal.azure.com) and select the *Azure Machine Learning*-Service
3. Create an *Azure Machine Learning* - Workspace. Using Azure Machine Learning, as a private person, you only need to pay for the compute ressources you use. For these tutorials it is more than sufficient to select the cheapest Compute Instance, which costs you around 0.07€/hour.
4. Launch the *Azure Machine Learning Studio* and start by creating your first *Compute* - Instance.
