# Data Science & Coding for Machine Learning - Tutorials

The goal of this repository is to:

- provide Coding Tutorials with a special focus on Coding with the intend of developing Machine Learning Solutions
- providing Tutorials and Infomaterial with a focus on Statistical Modelling/Machine Learning Models
- blogging aka. articles highlighting personal opinions on matters regarding Data Science/Machine Learning/and other related topics

The goal of this repository is to conduct personal research with the intention of publishing the research. Research can be in the form of:

# How to use this Repository
This repository consists of four folders:

- *dev_setup*: contains tutorials on how to Setup your development environment for Python Coding
- *coding*: contains Python Coding Tutorials and Python Coding exercises
- *modelling*: contains tutorials and infomaterial for Statistical Modelling and Machine Learning
- *articles*: contains articles about Data Science/Machine Learning/etc.

The focus of this repository will clearly lie on the folders *coding* and *modelling*. When it comes to Code I will only provide Python Code that is runable using the conda-Environment provided (I will try my best to keep everything updated in order to ensure that the Code really runs on your machines as well). For the Tutorials I will heavily rely on Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebooks

# Getting Started
To work through this tutorials all that is required is, that you have runtime that fulfills the following requisites:

- Python 3.10, with the following packages installed:
  - python=3.10
  - pandas=2.0
  - numpy=1.25
  - scikit-learn=1.2
  - black
  - pytest
  - pip
  - ipykernel
- Some IDE, with which you can run IPython Jupyter Notebooks
  - running your own Jupyter Notebook Server
  - using Visual Studio Code
  - using Azure ML Notebooks

If you have no idea, what the above requirements mean, I think these tutorials might be a bit to advanced for you. You might checkout the following other tutorials:
- provide a list of entry level tutorials

## Setting Up your Python Environment
If you have at least heard about the requirements stated above, but haven't setup your dev environment yet you can have a look at the following tutorials:

- Setting up a Python Coding Environment on Windows using WSL2, Anaconda and Visual Studio Code
- Setting up a Python Coding Environment using Azure Machine Learning

If you already have a working environment and you are already familiar with Python/Conda and Jupyter Notebooks you can directly start by cloning this repository and opening one of the tutorial notebooks in the folders *coding* or *modeling*.
