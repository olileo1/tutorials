# What the data!?
„The world‘s most valuable resource“, „Data is the new oil“, „We need to use Big Data“, „Karen bring me the data asap“... Everybody, who has been working in any company that actually pays his employees money has probably heard at least one of those sentences. Data is influencing the business agendas of all companies right now. The GDPR implemented in the European Union in May 2018 aims at protecting personal data of its citizens. But what exactly is data? Why is every company trying to collect and use data?    

When politicians talk about data, they are mostly talking about personal information like online activities, birthdates and wealth informations. But when meteorologists talk about data, they are thinking about air pressure, temperature and humidity in certain regions at certain points in time. When physicists talk about data, they are referring to physical measurements like air pressure, electrical voltage, mass or volume in their experiments.

The oxford online dictionary defines data as „facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis“ and further in a more philosophical way as „things known or assumed as facts, making the basis of reasoning or calculation“. Wikipedia further adds, that „data“ is the least abstract concept in the chain„data“, „information“, „knowledge“ and „wisdom“. Therefore data is everything that can be interpreted and thus produces information. So principally everything can be data. 

### A few examples
* All the words I typed into my keyboard in order to write this article, and deleted for some reason, is data. I could track all this words and in a few years analyze them. I could get some insights on my behavior when writing texts.
* I can write down the exact time of the day I hear any bird singing thus creating a dataset on hearable bird sounds at my favorite writing spot.
* A book anybody writes is data. In this case the author‘s story is the fact representing the data. The structure of sentences are facts on how the author thought the order of words should be.

Why is it important to me to emphasize that data is not only what is stored on your computer, but anything „known or assumed as facts“, is that I like to make absolute statements. One of those statements is „every decision should be data driven if possible (which means if there is data available)“. A lot of times I get the answer: „No, because sometimes personal experience is worth more than any data.“

# Excursion to the metaphysics of data
In his „allegory of the cave“ Plato metaphorically describes his concepts of forms and objects. In the famous allegory he describes how prisoners in a cave only see shadows of certain objects and events passing behind a wall. They don‘t see reality themselves, they only see a certain portrayal of reality. A lot of times we face the same problem with data. Data doesn‘t always represent the true fact. In many cases the correct understanding is: the data at hand is one specific representation of the fact.

This is due to two reasons:
* We only store facts we deem important for some cases
* We are limited to storing away only those facts we can somehow measure. We can not store away how the weather feels, but we can store meteorological measures describing the weather.

For example consider my dataset of bird noises I heared during a day at my favorite writing spot. The dataset could look like this:

09:02:35 Bird1
09:05:43 Bird2
10:23:17 Bird1
11:35:18 Bird1
13:34:47 Bird2

If you consider this dataset the absolute truth you would say something like:
At 09:02:35 Bird1 was making noises. At 13:34:47 Bird2 was making noises. Now consider that for example Bird2 always sleeps in the afternoon. You would say that the „data is wrong“ since it can not be, that Bird2 was singing in the afternoon.

But if you consider data as a specific representation of facts you would rather say things like:
At 09:02:35 Oliver was sitting in his spot and thought he heard Bird1 singing. At 13:34:47 Oliver was sitting in his spot and thought he heard Bird2 singing. 
Once you start seeing data like this it you can never say that „the data is wrong“. If you thought the data represented the absolute truth about what bird was singing at any given moment, it was your understanding of the data that was wrong.

To some this distinction may be unnecessarily complicated, but practitioners that are confronted with „wrong“ or „dirty“ data, may find this representation useful in convincing data providers that a correct understanding of data is important to draw the right conclusions. It is very easy to jump to wrong conclusions if your understanding of the data is wrong.

Consider another example. A hospital is taking the weight of its patients. In the first year they weighted the patients right after they went to the toilet, but in the second year for some fucked up reason they weighted the patients before they went to the toilet. If you ignore this fact you end up stating that patients get fatter every year, force your government to spend a lot of money for health care programs, resulting in the total collapse of the governmental budget, forcing your ministers to use public transport instead of luxury cars with drivers. Do you really want to live in such a country?

So if you ask me for a key take away: Data is always correct. It is your understanding of the data that can be wrong.
Of course in reality we normally don’t think like this, anyone thinking like this all the time would probably go crazy. But I am happy if I could make you think about the fact that there is always (and I really mean ALWAYS) some believe involved when we work with data, at least to the extend that it represents what we think it represents.
