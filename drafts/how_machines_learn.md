# How Machines Learn
- Basic Introductory examples
- Machines function by algorithms, in machine learning the algorithms are based on mathematical (most of statistical) principles

Nowadays facebook bombards me with advertisements like „Learn to master data science in just four weeks“ and „Apply to our special introductory course where you learn everything you need to know about machine learning“. These promises remind me the promises about growing your man parts by a few percent, that you see when you have taken the one or the other wrong turn browsing the internet. Consequently, after a couple of years getting paid for carrying the job title Data Scientist, I feel reminded of my high school years and the sex topic:
- Everybody is talking about it
- Most of the people kind of know how it works
- Only very very few are actually doing it
For the same reasons why we teach teenagers the facts of life I would like to explain to you the facts of Machine Learning, so that you are prepared when you are confronted with it, do it with the right people and protect yourself.

So what can you expect from this article?

Sticking to the whole sex ed comparison, let me put it this way: I want to deliver you the equivalent of a softcore sex movie:
Just like the whole „when a daddy loves a mummy“-explanation is a bit too abstract, I think you should know more than: „big companies collect data, magic happens and then they know more about you than yourself do“. But I also don‘t want to disturb you with the mathematical details.

So please don‘t be afraid to read on if you had troubles with mathematics in school. I also try to avoid the whole sex ed motif. I promise ;)

So how do they learn?
Algorithms! The answer is algorithms!
